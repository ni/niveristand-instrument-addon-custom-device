<h1>Message</h1>
<p class="Body">
This section contains the items for defining a message.  If the message is a write only, configure <strong>Command</strong> and delete the <strong>Response</strong>.  If the message is a read only, configure the <strong>Response</strong> and delete the <strong>Command</strong>.  If the message is a query (write then read) configure both.
<h2>What do you want to do?</h2>
<h3>Set Generation Type</h3>
<p>There are two types of generation that are currently supported.  One is a Trigger.  Triggers are mainly for single event messages.  As an example, setting the instrument configuration at the beginning of a test.  The other is Periodic & Trigger.  This has the same triggerable function but will automatically execute the message after a set period.  So, if you have a period of 1 second and don't trigger the message, it will automatically execute by itself.  If you trigger the message, the periodic timers get reset.</p>
<p>Note: The starting and stopping of the periodic generation can be controlled through the Enable Periodic channel.</p>
<p>Select the generation type from the <strong>Generation Type</strong> field.  <strong>Trigger</strong> will be the most common.  If you are sellecting <strong>Periodic & Trigger</strong>, set the <strong>Period (ms)</strong> to the desired setting.</p>
<p>Note: Limit the number of periodic messages as much as possible on slower protocols and baud rates as this could delay other messages.</p>
<h3>Automatically Include Message Protection</h3>
<p>Message protections are often used to make sure the data sent and received match.  Common protection schemes include checksums or CRCs.  To enable this, check the <strong>Include Protection</strong> field and select the desired type.  The protection will be automatically calculated for you and placed at the end of the message.</p>
