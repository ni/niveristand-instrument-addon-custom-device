<h1>Message Status</h1>
<p class="Body">This channel shows the current execution status of a message.  The channel value will go to 0 while the messages is going generated.  It will go to 1 when the message has been completed.</p>  
<p>Note: This channel does not indicate a successful transfer.  Use the Error Code channel for that.  This channel only indicates which message is currently being executed.</p>
<p>Note: If you are just sending a command with no response and it has been sent before (meaning its value is already 1), you will most likely not see a transition from 1 to 0 to 1 because it will happen so quickly.  You will most likely just see a constant channel value of 1.</p>
