<h1>Response</h1>
<p class="Body">This section contains the response equation.  Type in the equation and use [] to mark variables.  As an example, a command VRANGE[CH]? with a response [RANGE] would have response variable RANGE.  If there isn't a response required, delete this section.</p>
<h2>What do you want to do?</h2>
<h3>Create a Response</h3>
<p>
You create a response in the same way you create a command.  Enter the text (case sensitive) into the <strong>Response Format</strong> field.  The primary difference is this format defines how to parse data out of the response string and into VeriStand data channels where commands are the reverse.  Use [] to mark the variables in the response.  Then link those variables to your metadata channels in your custom device through the <strong>Linkages</strong> table.  Do this by highlighting the variable you would link to link and then selecting the desired metadata channel from <strong>Available MetaData Channels</strong>.
</p>
<h3>Create a Response Variable</h3>
<p>
Response variables are refered to as data.  To create a data channel, right click on the desired response section and select <strong>Add Data Channel</strong>.
</p>
<h3>Define Wait Type</h3>
<p>You can define how long to wait for a response either in seconds or in number of bytes.  A wait type of <strong>Wait sec</strong> will wait that amount of seconds, read the available bytes at the port, and read all the available data.  <strong>Byte Count</strong> will wait up to 10 seconds for the selected amount of data to be available, then read just that amount of data.  Set <strong>Wait Type</strong> and relating <strong>Value</strong> accordingly.</p>
<p>Note: You can use a channel for the wait value.  This allows you to change the number of bytes or wait time on the fly.  To do this, enable <strong>Use Channel?</strong> and select the desired channel.</p>
<h3>No Response Required</h3>
<p>If no response is required, delete the response section. Right click on the section and select <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
