<h1>Command</h1>
<p class="Body">This section contains the command equation.  Type in the equation and use [] to mark variables.  As an example, a command VRANGE[CH]:[VALUE] would have variables CH & VALUE.  This would allow the user to set a voltage range on a specific channel.  If there isn't a command required, delete this section.</p>
<h2>What do you want to do?</h2>
<h3>Create a Command</h3>
<p>You create a command by entering the text (case sensitive) into the <strong>Command</strong> field.  This text defines what strings and VeriStand data get sent to the instrument.  If desired, you can make the command static.  As an example, you can enter VSET1:10.000.  This would set the voltage range on channel 1 to 10 volts.  However, if you do this, you would need to create the same message for any additional channels or ranges (ie. VSET2:10.000).  Instead, you can parameterize the commands with variables.  Use [] to mark the variables in the command.  Then link those variables to your metadata channels in your custom device through the <strong>Linkages</strong> table.  Do this by highlighting the variable you would link to link and then selecting the desired metadata channel from <strong>Available MetaData Channels</strong>.</p>
<h3>Create a Command Variable</h3>
<p>Command variables are refered to as metadata.  To create a meta data channel, right click on the desired Command or on Global MetaData Channels and select <strong>Add MetaData Channel</strong>.</p>
<h3>No Command Required</h3>
<p>
If no command is required, delete the command section. Right click on the section and select <strong>Delete</strong>.
</p>
<h3>Force a Message Length</h3>
<p>Some protocols require messages to always be a certain length.  If your instrument requires this, enable <strong>Pad</strong>.  Then set the desired <strong>Length</strong> and <strong>Pad Value</strong>.</p>
<p>Note: Length is total message size including any message protection.  So, if the message is twenty four bytes of data and two bytes of protection, enter twenty six as the length.</p>
